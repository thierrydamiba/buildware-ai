## Simple Setup

Follow these steps to get the simple version of Buildware running.

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mckaywrigley/buildware.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Setup Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local` and fill in the required variables.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

The following values are required for config for the simple version:

App Mode (keep default value):

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_MODE=simple`

LLMs:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY=`

Database:

- `DATABASE_URL=`

GitHub:

- `GITHUB_PAT=`

### 4. Setup Database

You will need a Postgres database to use Buildware.

We recommend using [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) or [Neon](https://neon.tech/).

Once you have your connection string, update the `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env.local` file.

Next, run the database migrations:

```bash
npm run migrate
```

Now your database is ready to use.

### 5. Setup GitHub PAT

You will need a GitHub PAT (Personal Access Token) to use Buildware.

Follow these steps:

1. Go to [this link](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta).
2. Click "Generate new token".
3. Give your token a name and set the expiration date.
4. Select a "Resource owner".
5. Select which repositories you want to access. You must select either "All repositories" or "Only select repositories".
6. Select the 3 required repository permissions:
   - Contents: Read and write
   - Pull Requests: Read and write
   - Metadata: Read-only (this is selected by default)
7. Click "Generate token".
8. Copy your new PAT.

Once you have your PAT, update the `GITHUB_PAT` in the `.env.local` file.

### 6. Run App

```bash
npm run dev
```
